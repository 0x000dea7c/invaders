# invaders

Second game in C++ and OpenGL with not too many dependencies

WIP - WORK IN PROGRESS

# External dependencies

## GNU/LINUX

The idea was to not use any, but don't have much time left for audio, text and image processing. Might get into them eventually.

- libvorbis: pre-installed in most distros
- SDL_mixer & SDL: you need to install this separately
- Freetype (freetype2): you probably need to install this separately, too

## Textures/images

Thank you for your generosity.

- Enemies:

Some of these are modified for them to fit better in-game.
