Second game in C++ and OpenGL with not too many dependencies

The idea was to not use any, but don't have much time left for audio and image processing

WIP - WORK IN PROGRESS

# Dependencies

## GNU/LINUX

- X11 lib: pre-installed in most distros
- OpenGL lib: pre-installed in most distros
- PulseAudio lib: pre-installed in most distros
- libvorbis: pre-installed in most distros
- stb_image.h and stb_vorbis.c: included in src code, you don't have to worry

- Freetype (freetype2): you probably need to install this separately if you don't have it already
